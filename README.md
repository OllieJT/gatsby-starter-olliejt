#### Before you dive in...

This is one of my personal quickstart projects, a repo that I clone to get up and running faster. Commits might be messy, there may be bugs. **I am open to feedback** but this isn't my job.



# My Gatsby Starter

A gatsby starter is the best way to start any Gatsby project. If you have the [gatsby-cli](https://google.com) installed you can run `gatsby new PROJECT_NAME https://github.com/OllieJT/gatsby-starter-olliejt` this will start a new project and clone this repo for you.

At a later date I plan to add more notes to clarify the details of this setup.
